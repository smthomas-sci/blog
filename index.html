                <p class="first_para">The purpose of this collection of
                thoughts and ideas is to give back to the world what I have
                indulged in and benefited from immensely over the years; the
                free access to the ocean of human thought and expression that
                is the internet. It is perhaps the greatest collective project
                we have undertaken as a species and remains, in general, an
                organic process where by people add their own paint to the
                canvas.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In my case, I hope what exists here is a nexus to ideas
                    pertinent to our current and future problems. I am
                    continually inspired, challenged and consoled by the words
                    of thoughtful, articulate and compassionate people from all
                    over the world. My hope is to pay that forward in some way.
                    It is tremendously difficult to be original in a world
                    abundant with ideas and thinkers that span a recorded
                    history of at least 10,000 years; One has never read
                    enough. Yet it is humbling and fortuitous that so much of
                    what already exists is worth repeating.
                    <p>

                    <p>My interests span biology, computation, education, literature, history, music, philosophy
                        and human progress. Across this collection are musings of various length on these topics and more. The content
                        is largely that what I think is interesting, and think others might be interested in too. I also have a
                        <a target="_blank" href="./reading-list.html" class="link">reading list</a>,
                        where I compile books that have shaped my thinking. I have never been successful in recommending books,
                        and I've come to think that just how <i>wands choose their wizards</i>, books choose their readers*.
                    </p>

                    <p> I often use the following words to describe my thinking:
                        <a class="def" target="_blank" href="definitions.html#w_humanism">humanist</a>,
                        <a class="def" target="_blank" href="definitions.html#w_optimism">optimist</a>,
                        <a class="def" target="_blank" href="definitions.html#w_fallibilsm">fallibilist</a>.
                        Politically, it is sufficient to say my philosophy tends towards maximising human
                        choice and creativity.
