        #### Nameeta So how can AI be sentient? 16:13 Well let's start first with how
        you define sentience... like one could argue that humans are machines and all
        of our decision making, thought processing etc. is just a result of processing
        input data and learning from stimuli over the course of our lives. In THAT
        case, sure. AI can learn a bunch of stuff and continue to learn and then make
        it's own novel decisions/processing etc. based on that. 16:14 But.. what about
        sentience, like knowing you exist in a reality? 16:14 Do you believe in
        reality? Or are we all plugged into the matrix? 16:16 I think the perception
        part of sentience is an easier path to a resounding yes, but like souls and the
        likes? Maybe not so much.


        #### Simon

        You raise of a lot of the big questions on the topic. I like your definition of
        sentience, which I would rephrase and extend as saying, "a system's model of
        the world includes itself, its current state, it's own history, and perceived
        future states and actions".  In that sense, it's own future actions and states
        are in most part determined by the system itself, rather than it's inputs.
        Since the system itself is inherently dynamic, self-referential and changing,
        it can be unpredictable by it's nature. I'm not saying that it is always
        unpredictable, but that it has the propensity to be so, particularly if part of
        what the system does is create new knowledge. For example, you could not
        predict how people would respond to the situation of nuclear war before 1945,
        because the knowledge of nuclear weapons was not yet created. So I think
        creativity plays a major role, and specifically, that new knowledge is being
        created. By knowledge I mean ideas that are conserved in their environment, or
        persist in their environment. A system might have a glimpse of including itself
        in its model of the world, but it may not hang around because it is not useful
        to it. That said, I think there could be a spectrum of the presence of
        sentience in systems. For example, I think at the very least organisms in the
        phyllum Chordata would be sentient (Octopus is a clear exception to that
        grouping, which is definitely sentient). I don't think it's controversial to
        say that their model of the world includes themselves, and it persists over
        their lifetime, not just some fleeting insight. It plays a functional role in
        the behaviour, rather than them just being mindless eaters. However, not all
        animals are creative in the sense of creating new knowledge. That's probably
        reserved for a handful of species e.g. humans, some birds, perhaps other
        primates, octopus. So I would say humans are not like other animals, because we
        obviously possess the ability to create new knowledge, and hence are
        self-determining, rather than environmentally determined. Most animals live and
        die with the same repertoire defined by their genetics. We are born similarly
        with certain genetic predispositions, but routinely overwrite them at the level
        of ideas and culture. The main idea is that humans are obviously information
        processing machines. But further than that, we aren't mere calculators with a
        fix repertoire, but general purpose. That is, we can compute any computable
        function. So at the very least we are a Turing Machine, or our brains are from
        a hardware perspective. It might even be that genetics has endowed dogs and
        cats with brains that are also Turing Machines. But importantly, it isn't the
        computer that instructs the program what to do, but the program that instructs
        the computer what to do. Given that, we extend to another level of
        universality, we are general purpose knowledge creators, which is a type of
        program, not a type of computer. And because it is a program, it means that it
        could be run on any Turing Machine. So it's conceivable that we could one day
        create a sentient being that runs on hardware that is not biological. Of
        course, what most people overlook is that in creating a person, that new person
        is entitled to the same moral life as us. Why people think it is okay to
        enslave such a mind I'm not sure, but history obviously shows that those rights
        are not always obliged. It also means we could transcend our own biology. We
        are already storing memory externally, first as paper notebooks, now as phones
        etc. We replace limbs with prosthetic devices, we replace brain stem signals
        with pace makers. So I think this all points to something very curious, that
        suggests we really are something special and at the same time immaterial. We
        are a special kind of program, a creative program, a knowledge creating program
        that can learn anything, and conceivably in the long run is formless. You could
        call that a soul in some sense. Perhaps not indestructible,  but none the less,
        it is our essence. Do I believe in reality? Yeah, sure. I think there is a
        world out there for us to discover, in the scientific realism sense. I'm not
        sure I agree with the "plugged into the matrix" premise. There may be other
        worlds out there, sure. But as best as I can tell, we are not only in this
        world, but of this world. There is such a thing as death. But, if we arrive in
        heaven then that is when we should start worrying about whether we are plugged
        into the matrix. Then again, many cultures consider this "other world"
        hypothesis a key part of their world-view e.g. Nirvana, Valhalla, Hades.  It's
        only in recent times we've called it a "matrix" with trepidation, when it used
        to be invited. It's a pretty normal idea.  Regardless, I think we have infinite
        possibilities to explore in this world already.



        With all that said, we have no idea how to create a machine like that, in the
        sense of every one is pursuing the Holy Grail of Artificial General
        Intelligence. But we already know how to create AGI, and that is by having
        human babies. My view general cuts against the grain of pessimism and
        misanthropy which defines so called "learned people" in the 21st Century. It's
        intellectually in vogue to denigrate humans, but in reality not many people
        take that view seriously, nor should they. Problems are only solved with
        knowledge, and the only knowledge creating process we know of exists in the
        minds of humans. Therefore, humans are not the problem, but in fact, the
        solution, and our hope for the future. 18:52 Just my two cents. Or 20 dollars.


        #### Nameeta

        I love the optimism in this world view and I'm reading it with a renewed spring
        in my step. Many dollars indeed. Largely unrelated thoughts but my 2 cents
        back: Agree that levels of sentience vary by program (aka organism)... but
        you're saying we are the only ones that can create the solutions. Aren't all of
        the "BIG" problems we have to solve created by us because of our own lack of
        perception about what the new knowledge we generate will bring? E.g. nuclear
        weapons, unceded States, Facebook and social media, climate change... the list
        goes on. It seems we only get to "solving" problems after we've had input data
        about the problem itself, otherwise why would we have created it? I know what
        you're going to say... all of these things had benefits as well. Nirvana - at
        least according to Hindus - is not a place, but an enlightened existence
        achieved through several loops of shut-downs and restarts (reincarnations)...
        i.e. more input data, allowing a program to learn and re-learn until it unlocks
        the "next level" so to speak. So I think we are in agreement here on the
        definition of sentience, but can a NOVEL human created machine / program be
        sentient (and I don't mean babies)? No I don't think so.. mostly because of the
        limits of our own sentience. We know how to make biological AI (procreation)
        but we don't know what it is that makes them sentient. So how can we apply that
        artificially?

        Maybe there's a temporal element too - I guess I'm saying in our lifetime will
        we see artificial machines that "think for themselves"? I don't think so. Ps.
        Have you read Pluto? The Urasawa manga that Astroboy was based on? 19:30 I
        enjoyed it and its semi related to this discussion. 19:33 Pps. Don't get me
        wrong... I'm sure we can build AI that simulates sentience. Mostly relying ok
        the lack of knowledge on the general public about how these systems work. But I
        don't think we can or will ever be able to build truly sentient machines by our
        definition above. (edited)


        ### Simon

        Point 1: Problems are inevitable. Some a consequence of malice and ignorance,
        and other's just part of the natural order of things (parasitic eye worms). And
        the size of the problem is a matter of knowledge and wealth. I would say an
        asteroid hitting the earth is a BIG problem, until we know how to deflect them,
        then not so much. Climate change is the same. With the right knowledge to
        transform resources (wealth) in the direction of the problem, we might look
        back at it as being difficult at the time, not so much now. But by that stage
        we might be dealing with asteroids or massive solar flare, or the explosion of
        Yellow Stone National Park, which are harder problems, require much more
        knowledge and wealth to solve. This is by no means arguing for a guarantee. We
        might in fact all die because we failed. But in principle there is nothing
        standing in our way.

        Point 2: Point taken. Although I'm wondering where the storage device is that
        keeps track of karma? Is it in this world too? And how do souls get from one
        body to the next? There could at least be a few extra hidden dimensions that
        constitute the same "place".

        Point 3: We have no idea how to make artificial people. Because of that, most
        people think we can somehow evolve it with genetic programming, or if we just
        have a big enough [insert model, dataset, training time etc.] My point is it is
        not a matter of hardware, but a matter of software. Once we know how to do it,
        we could instantiate it on the smallest of hardware, and the largest of
        hardware.

        Re: karma... good question. I'll have to ask my dad if that's explicit
        somewhere. Who stores karma? Hindus have a bunch of gods but they are all part
        of this world. I don't think we've got anyone that is omnipresent.. so then who
        stores karma? Well actually just typing this now, I think that's the "soul"
        which comes with you from one life to the next.

        #### Nameeta


        Lol in my family whatsapp group, my parents and auntie's + uncle's from around
        the world and I have been solving the latest NY Times viral puzzle and sharing
        our results. My dad is notoriously bad at these kinds of things (think Wordle,
        Sudoku, etc.).. he just doesn't see the point but me, a couple of my auntie's
        from Germany and one from the US get really into it. Today he suggested that we
        should just use AI to solve these puzzles and it kicked off a huge chat about
        what makes us human... it made me think of above. Of course a program would be
        able to solve a simple computational puzzle more efficiently (maybe even
        effectively) than we would - yet humans, arguably the most complex form of
        "intelligence", engage in simple puzzles as a challenge! To keep the mind
        sharp! For fun! Does the answer to the meaning of life lie in these little
        delights? Amongst the 1-9 array of your Sunday morning Sudoku?


        #### Simon

        ohhhh, nooo. Your dad did what I did to my wife - suggesting it is pointless
        and I can solve it quickly using Bayesian Maximal Information (she puts up with
        my BS...). In reflection I was just being a dick. It isn't about solving it
        (brute force algorithms will do that just fine), but it is about you solving
        it, because you find it fun to do so. So I 100% agree with you. Keep  doing it!

        #### Nameeta

        I listened to an interesting podcast this morning and wondered what your
        thoughts were on how humans will perform (or if they even have to) AI generated
        music. Is it something that will be linear and repetitive or have tempo that we
        are used to in your experience?



        #### Simon

        I'll try to avoid a loooooooooong answer.... There is one close approximation
        to what it would be like, which is live performance of electronic music, but it
        is programmed live. Perhaps the low-level version of a loop pedal. Someone
        stands on stage with an open terminal, and goes on a "musical" journey. As much
        as it can be rehearsed I think the major appeal is that it is largely
        improvised. There is one exact example of this, in the form of people playing
        with another artificial general intelligence  i.e another human. We set our own
        constraints on whether we want repetition, fixed or varying temp, or very much
        open-end free form, such as The Necks
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPwqBHTNx3k .




        #### Nameeta


        s AI generated art / poetry etc. still art?

        #### Simon

        Simon Thomas Simon Thomas 1 year ago

        I think of art as a process of representation, in the same way we think of
        language or mathematics as a process, an attempt to get at something. It exists
        in the realm of abstraction. In other words, we try to represent an object or
        idea, or discover new ones entirely, using a different form to what they really
        are. For example, a charcoal drawing of a face is not really the face.
        Moreover, F = ma, is it self not a law of physics, but an attempt to represent
        the thing that really is the thing we refer to as a law of physics, however
        immaterial. Of course, art is freer than that. Science is about what is really
        out there in the world, mathematics is about what is logically implied by
        certain axioms. Art, or rather, what it tries to represent, need not correspond
        to those or any constraints. It can represent anything through anything
        anything, providing us a means for universal equivalence. That could be why
        humans find it so appealing, if not spiritual or transcendental. It's also why
        all art is a form of abstract art, just existing at different levels of
        abstraction. The more abstract it is, the more it says about everything else
        and less about something in particular. However, art as an ideal is different
        in practice. You cannot get something from nothing, so all art is coloured with
        some sort of constraint,  whether in the brush strokes we see in a painting, or
        the inhaling breath of a singer we hear, the age of the sculptor, the era in
        which is was created etc. It is those constraints that make it accessible, and
        perhaps also what makes it interesting, that it both does and does not
        correspond to our expectations (probably explains something about humour as
        well). They are the bridge to get us from what we know, to the new possibility.
        More deeply, it follows Popper's epistemology, that all knowledge is theory
        laden. We cannot see something for what it truly is but only as our theories
        describe it. But we do make progress, and learn new ways of seeing. Many people
        can look at the same thing, but few see the same thing. In my view, AI
        generated art, is art, in the general sense it can represent anything, either
        according to its model of the world (informing its intent and interpretation of
        a prompt), or the model of the world of the observer. I think "good" AI art and
        poetry, will help us to see the world in a different way, and imagine new
        possibilities of abstraction, some that do or don't correspond to reality.
        (edited) 1 14 replies Nameeta Nameeta 1 year ago

        Two things to say here (primarily because I'm time limited, but I could talk to
        you about this for hours):

        Isn't "representation" a narrow definition of what art is / does? Isn't art the
        creation of something new? Feeding what we sense as "real" (see, hear, touch,
        feel..) and interpreting it to create a new sense for the audience? And to this
        end, maybe my question isn't so much "is AI generated art, art" but is it as
        valuable.. legitimate... creative.. as art generated by a human? My thoughts on
        this might be limited by my understanding of how AI-models that generate art
        and LLMs work - but if their "training data set" is just what humans have
        created previously, then there is no novelty in what they are producing. They
        are just learning from what we have created before and interpreting it. And in
        the same breath, I ask myself well isn't that what humans are doing? Learning
        about our "reality" through experience and then interpreting it? (edited)
        Nameeta Nameeta 1 year ago

        Do you feel deceived when you are moved by something generated by a computer
        vs. something generated by a human? Do you think there is value in the je ne
        sais quoi of sharing an abstracted human experience with another sentient being
        through art? Like how the artist is a part of the experience you as the
        viewer/reader is having?? Simon Thomas Simon Thomas 1 year ago

        Point 1 - I think I am using the word in the same way you intend. We are trying
        to instantiate "what we sense as 'real' (see, hear, touch, feel)..." - I would
        call that representation. On the legitimacy point, is art generated by this
        elephant legitimate? Skeptical: the creative process seems to be largely driven
        by humans, and so the knowledge in the elephants brains wasn't there because it
        "created" anything, but a human created it through the elephant. AI Systems are
        the same. Humans use them as they use the elephant. But the knowledge to
        produce such things may not be unique to homo sapiens, since other human
        species (e.g. Neanderthals) have been hypothesised to create art as well. It is
        valuable because someone i.e. a person, human or non-human, such as a
        Neanderthal, Extra-Terrestrial, Artificial General Intelligence, dolphins
        (maybe?!),  attributes value to it. There is no external authority on what
        constitutes valuable or not valuable. That like all things is just a guess.
        Point 2 - Almost agree with you, except that there IS novelty. Our attempts to
        copy and interpret the old is imperfect, which introduces errors, which then
        leads to something entirely new. Our fallibility is what endows us with
        creative potential. Otherwise we would just be perfect (and utterly boring)
        replicators (machines). This is in essence the same as how evolution by natural
        selection works. Point 3 - No. Well at least not any more deceived than when I
        think puppies are cute, or that my pets can elicit a loving and affectionate
        response from me. They contain the knowledge to do that to me, not because they
        created it themselves, but because we created (via selective breeding) them to
        do that. Current AI is the same. It knows how to push our buttons, because we
        deleted the ones that couldn't. Point 4 -  je ne sais quoi is an ever-receding
        frontier. A placeholder, as God (a supernatural explanation) once was or
        remains so. But, I think the growth of knowledge is infinite, and so there will
        always be  je ne sais quoi , and it will always be valuable and worth while
        sharing with other people (human or non-human). I think the nuance here is that
        the creative process in us, that part that makes us people, can create any kind
        of knowledge, that serves our own end. Animals are either programmed by
        evolution (a fixed repertoire)  or by us (open-ended repertoire). We are also
        programmed by evolution, but we routinely override it with our own programming,
        either through culture or self-reflection and criticism of our ideas and
        actions. Current AI is not a person, and does nothing towards its own ends. It
        might one day, indeed so might animals, or perhaps some already do have innate
        creativity - there is lots of interesting research on birds. But whether they
        do or don't should have no bearing on what you as an individual should find
        interesting. You are free to enjoy whatever you want. (edited) Nameeta Nameeta

        Back to point 2 for a moment - so AI is an imperfect machine? Fallible? I
        thought it just learned a bunch of existing stuff and then reproduced it
        (perhaps in a novel way, but novel only within the limits of it's programming).
        Maybe I'm wrong there? Isn't that exactly what makes human (read:
        sentient-being) created art more "real"? ... because of the glitches? Again,
        I'm limited by my superficial knowledge of how AI works here. Maybe it glitches
        to create too? Nameeta Nameeta 1 year ago

        And point 3, you made me think differently here. And perhaps that's the chasm
        I'm not ready to cross yet... part of makes art interesting to me is the
        connection with it's creator. I'm the person in the gallery reading the plaques
        to know what year, in what location the painting was painted. It adds to the
        story, the experience, the enjoyment for me. While I might be moved by
        something created by AI, I tend to have the "oh. " response when I find out.
        Nameeta Nameeta 1 year ago

        Out of interest, what is your favourite AI-created art? Maybe I've only seen /
        heard / read stuff that's been part of mainstream media because I don't seek it

        Ps. And look this is going to sound basic, but AI doesn't have feelings. So
        that's where I think the deceit comes in. How can you make me feel something if
        you don't feel? Simon Thomas Simon Thomas 1 year ago

        I think you are right that the extra dimensions, which AI cannot access, make
        it more enjoyable. For example, the life story of the artist etc. However,
        there are also other dimensions which make the art less enjoyable (irrationally
        in my opinion). For example, people like Michael Jackson's music less now due
        to the sexual abuse situation. However, those dimensions don't really have
        anything to do with the art. I would say those other dimensions, are only
        relevant if they explain something about the work, that if they didn't happen,
        the artwork would not be the same. I would assume that for some dimensions that
        is true e.g. the time it was created, the books the artist was reading which
        inspired the work, and other dimensions for which it is not true. i.e. I don't
        think MJ's music has anything to do with grooming children, and so enjoy it all
        you want, and protest the objection to his behaviour in other ways e.g. not
        buying blatant money grabs like remastered editions. Simon Thomas Simon Thomas

        Modern AI is currently a blank term but under the hood it is Machine Learning
        which powers it. They learn the same way we do, through trial and error. Simon

        I kind of get the feelings things, since it is a common understanding of what
        artists do. But there are people that don't have as many "feelings" as the
        average person  e.g. sociopaths, people on certain extremes of which get loped
        into ASD., hyper-rational people (supposedly). I don't think that makes them
        any less creative,  nor incapable of making art.  I've met people like that,
        many quite capable of performing music, and rapping, and dancing, painting etc.
        , and then they told me, they don't fully get other people. So in that sense, I
        think the general conception of what it means to be creative, and to do art,
        and much of what we think is unique to the average human, is too narrow. Simon

        lol anyway. Think twice before you ask me a question that has the slightest
        chance of being open-ended. Thanks for the question though, I enjoy thinking
        about these things. Simon Thomas Simon Thomas 1 year ago

        As for my favourite AI art, I think generative music is currently under-rated
        and will be huge. Just like text conditioning, you can do sound condition, and
        get an AI to generate the rest of the song. Check it

        I remember seeing these things in 2020 and my mind was blown. Nameeta Nameeta 1

        My husband and I have been debating this question ALL damn weekend!!!
        especially about generative music. Thanks for the best conversation I've had in
        a while!! And also, thanks for the Tuesday morning Rick-roll
