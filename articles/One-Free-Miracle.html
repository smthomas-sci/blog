    Rupert Sheldrake refers to a
    conversation he had with Terence McKenna in 1998 [1]. Sheldrake and McKenna are
    counter-culture figures, with Sheldrake's book positioning science as
    fraught with dogmas of its own, and McKenna contributing the 
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#:~:text=He%20believed%20that%20psilocybin%20mushrooms,'stoned%20ape'%20theory.%22">
    Stoned-Ape Theory of Human Evolution</a>, among other things. He quotes McKenna as saying
    that science proceeds on the granting of "one free miracle", which
    thereafter unfolds with a "seamless, causal explanation". Suffice to say,
    the material explanations which scientific orthodoxy posits sit
    uncomfortably with these two men. In particular, Sheldrake takes great
    effort to criticise the Gene-Centered view of the world, popularised in 
    <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Paperback/dp/B0722G5V92">The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins (1976)</a>.
    <p>

    <p>In this article, I want to explore the Gene-Centered view of the world, or more aptly,
    <b>Neo-Darwinism</b> in the context of the "one free miracle". I adore the phrase
    "one free miracle" because it succinctly captures the apparent absurdity of
    existence. Yet, Neo-Darwinism, despite Sheldrakes protestations, provides a
    powerful, consoling, and somewhat simple explanation to the problem (albeit still
    incomplete).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Beyond just explaining it abstractly, I would like to demonstrate the
    explanation so it unfolds as naturally as it has done in reality. To
    facilitate such an understanding, I will create simulations using Python,
    allowing you to verify the concepts for yourself. This is similar to work
    created by Primer on Youtube, which I highly recommend.
    </p>

    <h2>Something Vs. Nothing</h2>

    <p>
    We can think of existence as being a dichotomous phenomenon; something can
    either exist (ùëÜ), or not exist (ùëÅ ). Indeed, the set of all possible
    objects appears to be infinite, yet there is only one way of not existing.
    Hence, if one wants to put a probability on existence, it is simply 
    </p>

    <p>
    $$
    P(S) = \infty, P(N) = \dfrac{1}{\infty}
    $$
    </p>

    <p>
    Of course, this is not a legitimate way of describing the probability of any
    one thing in particular. Indeed, a single object has the same probability of
    existing as not existing if randomly sampled from the universal set i.e.
    exceedingly small ( $\tfrac{1}{\infty}$ ).
    </p>

    <p>
    This is the argument known as <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkyard_tornado#:~:text=The%20junkyard%20tornado%2C%20also%20known,to%20the%20origin%20of%20life%2C">Hoyle's Fallacy</a> which equates the emergence of
    life from non-living matter as being "comparable to the chance that a tornado
    sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials
    therein". It is precisely this argument which we will see to be false.
    </p>

    <p>
    Life as it is best understood exists by being born, and ceases to exist by
    dying. If we consider Hoyle's proposal of random chance we can imagine a
    universe where simple life is spawned into existence. Such a life form
    has a chance of being born, or a birth rate $B$ , and
    a chance of dying, a death rate $D$. We will represent this as follows:
