    Rupert Sheldrake refers to a
    conversation he had with Terence McKenna in 1998 [1]. Sheldrake and McKenna are
    counter-culture figures, with Sheldrake's book positioning science as
    fraught with dogmas of its own, and McKenna contributing the 
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna#:~:text=He%20believed%20that%20psilocybin%20mushrooms,'stoned%20ape'%20theory.%22">
    Stoned-Ape Theory of Human Evolution</a>, among other things. He quotes McKenna as saying
    that science proceeds on the granting of "one free miracle", which
    thereafter unfolds with a "seamless, causal explanation". Suffice to say,
    the material explanations which scientific orthodoxy posits sit
    uncomfortably with these two men. In particular, Sheldrake takes great
    effort to criticise the Gene-Centered view of the world, popularised in 
    <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Paperback/dp/B0722G5V92">The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins (1976)</a>.
    <p>

    <p>In this article, I want to explore the Gene-Centered view of the world, or more aptly,
    <b>Neo-Darwinism</b> in the context of the "one free miracle". I adore the phrase
    "one free miracle" because it succinctly captures the apparent absurdity of
    existence. Yet, Neo-Darwinism, despite Sheldrakes protestations, provides a
    powerful, consoling, and somewhat simple explanation to the problem (albeit still
    incomplete).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Beyond just explaining it abstractly, I would like to demonstrate the
    explanation so it unfolds as naturally as it has done in reality. To
    facilitate such an understanding, I will create simulations using Python,
    allowing you to verify the concepts for yourself. This is similar to work
    created by Primer on Youtube, which I highly recommend.
    </p>

    <h2>Something Vs. Nothing</h2>

    <p>
    We can think of existence as being a dichotomous phenomenon; something can
    either exist (ùëÜ), or not exist (ùëÅ ). Indeed, the set of all possible
    objects appears to be infinite, yet there is only one way of not existing.
    Hence, if one wants to put a probability on existence, it is simply 
    </p>

    <p>
    $$
    P(S) = \infty, P(N) = \dfrac{1}{\infty}
    $$
    </p>

    <p>
    Of course, this is not a legitimate way of describing the probability of any
    one thing in particular. Indeed, a single object has the same probability of
    existing as not existing if randomly sampled from the universal set i.e.
    exceedingly small ( $\tfrac{1}{\infty}$ ).
    </p>

    <p>
    This is the argument known as <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkyard_tornado#:~:text=The%20junkyard%20tornado%2C%20also%20known,to%20the%20origin%20of%20life%2C">Hoyle's Fallacy</a> which equates the emergence of
    life from non-living matter as being <i>"comparable to the chance that a tornado
    sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials
    therein"</i>. It is precisely this argument which we will see to be false.
    </p>

    <p>
    Life as it is best understood exists by being born, and ceases to exist by
    dying. If we consider Hoyle's proposal of random chance we can imagine a
    universe where simple life is spawned into existence. Such a life form
    has a chance of being born, or a birth rate $B$ , and
    a chance of dying, a death rate $D$. We will represent this as follows:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
class Replicator:
    """
    A simple life form called a replicator.

    Upon creation [ Replicator() ], the replicator has 
    a chance of being born according to its birth_rate, otherwise
    it is dead (self.alive = False)
    """

    def __init__(self, birth_rate: float, death_rate: float):
        self.B = birth_rate
        self.D = death_rate
        self.alive = True if random.random() <= self.B else False
        
    def step(self):
        """
        If replicator is alive, simulate chance of death.
        """
        self.alive = False if random.random() <= self.D and self.alive else self.alive

    

    </code></pre>

   
    <p>
    We can now create a replicator where $B=0.8$ and $D=0.2$, and then check if it is alive.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
    replicator = Replicator(0.8, 0.2)
    print(replicator.alive)
    --
    True
    </code></pre>

   
    <p>
    Life exists through time and so we can move to the next point in time using
    the <code class="lanauge-python">step()</code> method. This then simulates 
    the chance of death at that time step according to $D$.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
    replicator.step()
    print(replicator.alive)
    --
    True
    </code></pre>


    <p>
    We can simulate this over any number of steps to understand the replicators life-span.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Run over 10 time steps
for t in range(10):
    r.step()
    print(t+1, r.alive, end="\t")
--
1 True	2 True	3 True	4 False	5 False	6 False	7 False	8 False	9 False	10 False

    </code></pre>

    <p>
    This replicator dies after the third time step, but since it is random it
    is helpful to consider a whole <b>population</b> of replicators. Let's create
    $N=100$ replicators, and run 10 steps and count how many each are alive at
    each time step.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
N = 100
population = [ Replicator(birth_rate=0.8, death_rate=0.2) for n in range(N)]
tally = []

# Run over 10 time steps
for t in range(10):
    
    alive_at_t = 0
    # run step for each replicator
    for r in population:
    
        r.step()
        
        if r.alive:
            alive_at_t += 1
    
    # Save number of alive
    tally.append(alive_at_t)

# Show result
print(tally)
--
[64, 53, 43, 36, 29, 19, 18, 17, 15, 12]
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    We can see that most of them eventually die. However, we also have to
    include the fact that the universe spontaneously creates more replicators
    according to $B$. If we include this step, by adding to the population
    progressively and running the simulation much longer something
    interesting is revealed.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
N = 1
population = [ Replicator(birth_rate=0.8, death_rate=0.2) for n in range(N)]
tally = []

    alive_at_t = 0
    
    # Spontaneous generation of another replicator
    population.append(Replicator(birth_rate=0.8, death_rate=0.2))
    
    # Run step for each replicator
    for r in population:
    
        r.step()
        
        if r.alive:
            alive_at_t += 1
            
        # It's dead, so remove it
        else:
            population.remove(r)
    
    # Save number of alive

    </div>


    <p>
    We can see that the population grows and then shrinks, apparently
    oscilating around an <b>equilibrium</b>. To understand what is happening, let's
    considering the maths. If $B=D$, then the population would stay the same,
    because for every birth there is an equal chance of death. However, if they
    are <i>different</i>, then the number that can die depends on the number that are
    alive, $N$.

    $$
    B=N \times D
    $$

    This enables us to estimate the equilibrium by taking the ratio between the
    birth and death rates.

    $$
    N=BD
    $$
    
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
    B = 0.8
    D = 0.2
    N = B/D
    print(N)
    --
    4.0
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    Knowing this, we can predict the equilibrium population for a variety of
    different birth and death rates. The results show that the simulations
    behave according to theory, oscilating around their respective equilibria.
    e.g. $N = B / D = 0.9 / 0.02 = 45$.

    <div class="centered-img">
      <img id="img2" style="max-width: 1000px; margin: auto;">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="one-free-miracle/imgs/img2.js"></script>
    </div>

    </p>

    <p>
    Valid values to experiment with are between $0$ and $1$ .If you explore
    sufficiently you will discover something fundamental. It doesn't matter how
    small a chance there is of being born, as long as it is higher than the
    death rate. The only thing that matters is the <b>ratio</b>.

    We can summarise two important discoveries as follows.
    <ol>
        <li>Looking at individuals is unhelpful, and so a universe must
            spontaneously produce simple replicators to create a <i>population</i>.
            Importantly, a replicator at this stage need not refer to <u>life</u>
            as we understand it in its most complex form. It is simply an
            abstraction that we will explore in coming sections.
        </li>

        <li>It is the ratio between the chance of being born and the chance of
            dying that allows populations to grow, however slight the chances
            are of that population getting started. The only thing required
            under the most unlikely of circustances is <b>time</b>.
        </li>
    </ol>


    With enough time (~14 billion years for our own universe) theory tells us
    that life is an inevitability.


    <h2>Escape Velocity</h2>

    <p>
    The equilibrium for a given pair of birth and death rates appears to limit
    the size of the population. For $B=0.9$ and $D=0.01$, then the population
    is limited to $90$. You might wonder then, how does a population grow past
    that? $N$ scales inversely to $D$ and so if we decrease $D$ by another
    order of magnitude, we get

    $$
    N = \dfrac{B}{D} = \dfrac{0.9}{0.001} = 900
    $$


    We can increase $N$ simply by making the chance of death exceedingly rare.
    However, in doing so, the probability of having such a combination of $B$ and
    $D$ also becomes exceedingly rare. Below is the full space of combinations.
    The combinations with large population sizes occupy only a small portion of
    the full space. Yet, even if such a lucky combination is found $N$ is still
    bounded by the equilibrium. How does life get past this limit?

    </div>

    </p>


    <p>

    A clue comes from prexisting prokaryotic life, namely Bacteria. Populations
    of Bacteria increase because individuals <b>repliciate</b>(hence the use of
    the term Replicator!). If we assume that a single Bacertia is "born",
    within an environment is would have a death rate $D$ and a replication rate
    $R$. By replicating, a copy of itself is added to the population. We can
    update the Replicator class to include a replication rate and an ability to
    replicate.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
class Replicator:
    """
    A simple life form called a replicator.

        offspring = self.replicate() if random.random() <= self.R and self.alive else None
        
        self.alive = False if random.random() <= self.D and self.alive else self.alive
        
        return offspring

    </code></pre>

    <p>
    Given that replicators can now replicate, the combination of dying and
    replicating is going to effect the population. The number dying and is
    offset, or reduced by the number replicating. We can represent this as:

    $$
    (D \times N ) - (R \times N) = N(D-R)
    $$

    We can then substitute this into our original model:

    $$
    N = \dfrac{B}{D-R}
    $$

    However, the spontaenous birth rate must be zero, because the replicator
    cannot pop into existence without a parent. Therefore, the equation isn't
    helpful to us because $N$ is always $0$. A way past this is to forget about a
    birth rate of $0$ and change perspectives... 

    </p>

    <p>
    Thinking back to what was said in the first section, we know that if $B=D$,
    the population stays the same. When they are different then the population
    changes, either increasing or decreasing. We can write the expected change
    $\Delta$ as:

    $$
    \Delta = B - D
    $$

    We can include N to calculate the exact numbers for a given population.

    $$
    \Delta = B - (D \times N)
    $$

    But importantly, we now need to include the way replication increases the population.

    $$
    \Delta = (B+R \times N) - (D \times N) = B + (R-D) \times N
    $$

    This means that for any number of creatures, we can predict the change in
    the number. To begin, let's choose $B=1$, $D=0.2$ and $R=0$, so that no
    replication occurs. The change will be calculated for a range of $N=(0,10) $.

    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">
N = [ float(n) for n in range(11) ]
B = 1
R = 0
D = 0.2
Delta = [B + (R - D)*n for n in N]

      <script type="text/javascript" src="one-free-miracle/imgs/img4.js"></script>
    </div>

    
    <p>
    The orange dot shows us the equilibrium point, where if the population goes
    below $5$, the expected change goes up, and if it goes above $5$, then the
    expected change goes down. Now let's make $R=0.1$.

    </p>

    <div class="centered-img">
      <img id="img5" style="max-height: 400px; margin: auto;">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="one-free-miracle/imgs/img5.js"></script>
    </div>

    <p>
    In this case, since the replication rate increased, our equilibrium changed
    to $10$. If we run several simulations under these conditions we will see
    that the equilibrium is reached.
    </p>

    <div class="centered-img">
      <img id="img6" style="max-width: 1000px; margin: auto;">

    <p>
    If the replication rate equals the death rate then we have linear growth, always increasing by the birth rate.

      <script type="text/javascript" src="one-free-miracle/imgs/img7.js"></script>
    </div>
    
    <p>
    We when simulate this for a number of different populations we get the following:
    </p>


    <div class="centered-img">
      <img id="img8" style="max-width: 1000px; margin: auto;">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="one-free-miracle/imgs/img8.js"></script>
    </div>

    <p> 
    It becomes more interesting when the replication rate $R=0.2$ is higher than the death rate $D=0.1$.
    </p>

    <div class="centered-img">
      <img id="img9" style="max-width: 1000px; margin: auto;">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="one-free-miracle/imgs/img9.js"></script>
    </div>

    <p>
    We can now finally see how replication can lead to exponential growth. We have
    escaped the equilibrium point and the population is increasing!
    However, we have only considered when $B=1$, which guarentees spontaneous
    generation at each time step. What happens when populations depend only on
    replication?
    </p>

    <div class="centered-img">
      <img id="img10" style="max-width: 1000px; margin: auto;">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="one-free-miracle/imgs/img10.js"></script>
    </div>

    <p>
    Over the course of each of these simulations, if the population ever
    reaches $0$ than they get stuck - this is called <b>extinction</b>. Life that
    depends only on replication survives by walking a very thing line. How much they are
    at risk of extinction depends on sensitive difference between $R$ and $ùê∑$. In
    this case, 42% of the 200 simulated populations went extinct.
    </p>

    <p>
    We have so far depended on our "one free miracle" with a starting
    population of at least $1$. This leaves us with an interesting predictament.
    If complex organisms always need a parent, but they can't replicate unless
    they already exist, how do they get started in the first place?

    All life on Earth utilies a genetic code, based on either ribonucleic acid
    (RNA), or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It is theorised that early life
    emerged from RNA, a code which has four symbols:
    <span class="baseA">A</span>,
    <span class="baseU">U</span>,
    <span class="baseG">G</span>,
    <span class="baseC">C</span>. The symbols
    strung together form sequences such as:
    
    <ul>
        <li><span class="baseG">G</span><span class="baseC">C</span><span class="baseG">GG</span><span class="baseA">AA</span></li>
        <li><span class="baseA">AAAA</span><span class="baseU">UU</span></li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
    What sequences we see in living organisms today are not random. However, we
    can simplify the scenario to say that the simplest lifeform in our
    simulated universe has a sequence of just <span class="baseA">A</span>.
    Being incredibly simple, they spontenously emerge from the environment.
    Once alive they can also replicate or die. However, when they undergo 
    replication, there is a chance $M$, that their offspring will be a 
    mutant with a genetic code of <span class="baseU">U</span>. This new 
    <b>genetic variant</b> turns out not to be very good, and in fact has a
    higher death rate than its parent.
    </p>

    <p>
    We can update the <code>Replicator</code> class to include the RNA code, 
    and see what happens when we run a simulation with the following parameters.

    This shows us that a steady stream of simple replicators of type <span
        class="baseA">A</span> will reach an equilibrium. Yet from that
    population, every so often one will mutate to <span class="baseU">U</span>,
    which despite it's chance of death, gains an ability to replicate. Of
    course, it's chance of death is greater and so it inevitably tends towards
    extinction. It just wasn't a good mutation. Let's look at a new equation to
    incorporate the mutation.

    $$
    \Delta = B + (R (1-M)-D) \times N
    $$

    We modify the replication value, by saying that if 1% are going to mutate,
    then 99% will replicate as usual, hence $R(1‚àíM)$. Now if we multiply out the
    equation an interesting term pops out.

    $$
    \Delta = B + RN - RMN - DN
    $$

    It is $RMN$, which is the total number of <span class="baseA">A</span> that mutate to
    <span class="baseU">U</span>. We can use this term to keep track of the number of 
    each type, by adding it to it's expected popuation equation as follows:

    $$
    \Delta A = B_{1} + (R_{1}(1-M_{1}) - D_{1}) \times N_{1}
    $$

    $$
    \Delta U = B_{2} + (R_{2}(1-M_{2}) - D_{2}) \times N_{2} + R_{1}M_{1}N_{1}
    $$

    Let's now simulate a universe where many mutations are possible. The following rules will apply:

    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Birth, Death, Replication and Mutation Rates</b>
    <ul>
        <li> <span class="baseA">A</span> $B=1, D=0.5, R=0,   M=0.01$   </li>
        <li> <span class="baseU">U</span> $B=0, D=0.8, R=0.7, M=0.05$ </li>
        <li> <span class="baseG">G</span> $B=0, D=0.8, R=0.5, M=0.1$  </li>
        <li> <span class="baseC">C</span> $B=0, D=0.3, R=0.6, M=0$    </li>
    </ul> 

    <b>Allowable Mutations</b>
    
    $$
    A \rightarrow U \rightarrow G \rightarrow C
    $$

    After running the simulation for 250 steps we experience a population
    explosion. The <span class="baseC">C</span> begins growing exponentially
    once emerging after only a couple of <span class="baseG">G</span> appear.
    We can see that from the constant production of basic replicators (
    <span class="baseA">A</span>), we can mutate towards something that has
    exponential growth. In this way, we have shown that we can generate
    complexity and in large numbers by building on top of the most basic
    replicator. Even from a succession of bad mutations 
    (<span class="baseU">U</span>, <span class="baseG">G</span>), we have seen that we
    can eventually get exponential replicators which, with the environment
    permitting, could later result in even more interesting mutations.

    <p>
    This is an enormous discovery; it tells us that no miracle is necessary! We
    only have to consider the simplest replicator in the environment,
    <i>so simple that the environment naturally produces it</i>. If the environment allows
    variation by way of mutation, and a particular mutation confers the ability
    to replicate, then under such conditions life is an inevitabilty.

    <h2>Survival of the Fittest</h2>

    <p>
    We have previously seen the expected change equation as:

    $$
    \Delta = B + (R-D) \times N
    $$

    and if $ùëÖ \gt D$ then we get an exponential growth curve.

    </p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>
    <i>Existence</i> - The dichotomy of either being alive or dead.
    <p>

    <p>
    <i>Neo-Darwinism</i> - A theory of evolution by natural selection where by the unit of selection is a gene within a population.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Replicator</i> - The most basic form of life whose structure allows it
    to make (imperfect) copies of itself.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Population</i> - A collection of genes upon which selection takes place.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Equilibrium</i> - The fixed point around which population numbers
    fluxuate.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Birth:Death Ratio</i> - The ratio between the rates that molecular
    structures come in and out of existence
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Mutation</i> - A spontaneous structural change within a molecular
    structure or replicator which confers an existantial advantage or
    disadvantage.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Replication</i> - the process available to replicators that allows their
    population to grow exponentially (if the replication rate is greater than
    the death rate)
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Extinction</i> - refers to the permanent demise of a population of
    replicators whose death rate exceeds their replication rate.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Scarcity</i> - the resource limiations imposed on replicators by their
    environment (includes other replicators), denying the possibility of
    infinite growth and therefore leading to competition for those resources.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Carrying Capacity</i> - the total number replicators that an environment
    can sustain (theoretically, but impossible to calculate in practice)
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Selection</i> - The process where replicators with disadvantagous mutations are
    removed from the population through death.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Adapation</i> - The process where replicators accumulate mutations well-suited
    (tentatively) to survival in the environment
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Fitness</i> - the competative capacity of a replicator to replicate.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
    The contended "one free miracle" is not necessary to explain our seemingly
    improbable circumstance. In a universe of abundant elementary molecules, we
    see the spontaneous process of chemical reactions manfiest the entrance and
    exit of existence. This is hardly improbable given it is the natural order
    of things. Given enough time, mutations serendipitously lead to molecular
    units which can make copies of themselves. At this point we've reached
    escape velovity, with exponential growth transforming the world, not by
    degree but kind. Of course, the peristant problem of imperfect replication
    allows for differential advantage to be found at every turn, with equal
    risk of surival or extinction. In pockets of the environment where
    resources are limited, competition ensues, where by replicators are
    increasingly adapted to the task of replication. Despite this process
    elegantly explaining the abundant and diverse presence of life on our
    planet, it is critical to realise evolution operates only in hindsite.
    There is no direction, no up towards which it aims. Despite this, we are
    witness to a beautiful creative force on the world by which physics is the
    only limiation to its ingenuity. More impressively, we understand it and
    now see that evolution is just as formormidable as all other forces of
    nature.
