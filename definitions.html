								<h1 style="font-family: Bebas Neue;">Definitions</h1>

								<p>
								Definitions are inherently authoritarian. The common interpretation is that the meaning
								of words, that is to say, what people <i>mean</i> when they use words, is the same and forever unchanging.
								But you only have to use language to find out that is not the case. There is no authority
								we can turn to on what words mean, just as is there is no authority on whether British, American, Indian
								or New Zealand English is the <i>correct</i> English. They are forever changing, underpinned
								by what people mean. And meaning is not explicit, and so whenever we find ourselves
								confused by the way people use words, we ask them to <i>explain</i> themselves. The only <i>objective
										truth</i> to the matter is the <i>intended</i> meaning. Whether that can be faithfully reproduced using
								words or letters, or even successfully understood by the listener/reader makes understanding
								other people inherently difficult. And so if we value truth, we must be patient and diligent in trying to
								make communication easier. To aid that effort, below is my list of *definitions of words
								I use which may differ to common use, or I feel should be clarified where I anticipate confusion.

								will be included as needed.</p>

						<div id="definitions">


								<div class="def_item" id="w_humanism">
										<span class="def_word">Humanism:</span>
										<span class="definition">
												A world-view posits that the problems, concerns, interests and aspirations of humans have
												inherent value and importance. Thus in navigating our journey through life, solutions to our personal
												moral problems necessarily accommodate the existence and values of other humans. Humans belong
												to a family of conscious beings that more generally we refer to as "people", which includes Extra
												Terrestials (if they exist) and Artificial General Intelligence (if and when it is created).
												By possessing personhood, humans are cosmically significant.
										</span>
								</div>

								<div class="def_item" id="w_science">
										<span class="def_word">Science:</span>
										<span class="definition">
												A framework of ideas by which people come to understand physical reality. It encompasses
												the modes of criticism utilised by rationality, with the added criterion that physical evidence
												can be used to refute, or tentatively corroborate hypotheses. Thus the difference between scientific
												hypotheses and all other hypotheses is that they are guesses about physical reality, and so can be
												demonstrably refuted by physical reality. In contrast, mathematical hypotheses need not, and indeed
												may not correspond to physical reality.
										</span>
								</div>

								<div class="def_item" id="w_fallibilsm">
										<span class="def_word">Fallibilism:</span>
										<span class="definition">
												The proposition that knowledge is obtainable through conjectures and criticism, but certainty is
												not. Consequently, no knowledge, and no ideas in general, are above criticism. This implies that
												progress is possible due to the existence of error. We can be less wrong but we can also be mistaken.
										</span>
								</div>

								<div class="def_item" id="w_person">
										<span class="def_word">Person / People:</span>
										<span class="definition">
												The species of being which possesses the knowledge to create more knowledge, and importantly
												explanatory knowledge. This has two consequences: (1) knowledge creation is unbounded except where physically
												impossible (e.g. time constraints), (2) in order to successfully explain the universe (the task of science) we
												need to include phenomena which create knowledge. Thus people are cosmically significant in the
												totality of understanding.
										</span>
								</div>

								<div class="def_item" id="w_optimism">
										<span class="def_word">Optimism:</span>
										<span class="definition">
												The position that recognises that "<i>problems are inevitable</i>"<sup>[1]</sup> but that problems are
												soluble given the right knowledge. In other words, "<i>All evils are the result of insufficient knowledge</i>"<sup>[1]</sup>.
												For example, the tragedy of infant
												mortality has been largely overcome with the right knowledge. Moreover, not only
												does such knowledge exist, but that it is attainable through knowledge creation. Since we know
												how to create knowledge (via conjecture and criticism) we can create the right knowledge, if no physical
												limitations exist (e.g. time constraints). We therefore have reason to be optimistic in overcoming
												our problems in the long run.
